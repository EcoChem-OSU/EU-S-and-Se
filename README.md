# Python script for predicting EU S and Se soil concentrations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
-----------
Built four machine-learning (ML) techniques prediction of sulfur and Selenium soil concentration. 
ML techniques includes: 
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor, 
- Support Vector Regression using the linear support vector regression (Lin-SVR) 
- Support Vector Regression using radial basis function (RBF-SVR) kernels
- Random Forest Regressor (RFR).
                        
> [!NOTE]
> **After critical evaluation, we retain two ML techniques, linear support vector regression (Lin-SVR) models for S and Se and the multilayer perceptron model (MLP) for Se.**

Input variable of the mode are: 
- Clay content, soil PH
- Soil organic carbon (SOC) content
- Average daily precipitation (Precip)
- Average daily evapotranspiration (ET)
- Aridity index (AI)
- Average chemical index of alteration (CIA)
- Total S or Se atmospheric deposition.
                                
Implementation details
----------------------
Machine learning tool programmed in Python using functions developed by scikit-learn version 1.1.2,43.
Included Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor, Support Vector Regression using the linear support vector regression (Lin-SVR) 
and radial basis function (RBF-SVR) kernels, and Random Forest Regressor (RFR).
